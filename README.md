# Investments

I have saved the JSON data in a text file and then uploaded it to Firebase realtime database. I have used Calender for getting dates and then storing them to 
indivial lists for last week, last month and last year. Then I have compared the list with the dates stored in FIrebase database and then if the dates are equal then I have 
stored total values of mf_sips and stocks and then added them. On clicking the button you can get the combined value of mf_sips and stocks for that period.

I would suggest you to click buuton after 3-4 seconds on opening the app as Firebase Database takes 2-3 seconds for processing.
